I'm an NSF-Simons Quantitative Biology Fellow at Harvard University (https://quantbio.harvard.edu/mathbio). I obtained my Ph.D in Physics from UC San Diego, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Massimo Vergassola. My research interests lie at the intersection of physics, biology, and machine learning. My general approach is to (a) identify important biological problems which are currently intractable, (b) identify tools, ideas, and approaches from physics and computer science which are well-matched to the biological system, and (c) develop these tools and theories so they can tackle the biological question (and others of that variety). My areas of study include the soaring of birds, olfactory neurobiology, quantitative genetics & evolution, and the physics of animal behavior & navigation. While the questions span diverse biological systems, they are unified at the conceptual and methodological level by a common decision-making framework. 

Research summary
======

Algorithmic aspects of animal behavior
------
My graduate research contributions were largely focused on identifying the algorithmic aspects of animal behavior and navigation. Within this general framework, I focused on the following three biological systems: 

(A) Convective flow-based navigation: How do birds soar, i.e., how do they exploit atmospheric convection to gain height with minimal energy expenditure? We developed an approach using reinforcement learning (RL) to train virtual gliders in a turbulent convective flow and identified mechanosensory cues and navigational strategies that birds could use to soar. These theoretical results were validated using remote-controlled gliders, which we programmed to be autonomous and trained in the field to navigate atmospheric thermals. 

(B) Olfactory navigation: I worked on theoretical aspects of sensing and navigation. In particular, we showed using the prototypical multi-armed bandit framework that highly successful information-theoretical approaches to optimal sensing can in fact be extended to situations that combine sensing and decision-making. Graduate thesis work on olfactory navigation is still under preparation and includes contributions to how animals track surface-borne odor trails, multi-modal olfactory sensing using airborne and surface-borne cues and an invited review to appear on olfactory navigation in turbulent environments. 

(C) Chemotaxis within fluids: As a postdoctoral fellow, I developed a generally applicable unsupervised learning algorithm based on homology-search models to identify characteristic patterns in animal behavior. The idea is to develop a contrastive framework for behavioral modeling (rather than a descriptive one) that allows us to identify which aspects of behavior are most relevant in any particular environment. In an experimental collaboration with the Wyart lab at ICM, Paris, we used this algorithm to identify the chemotactic response of zebrafish larvae to aversive stimuli. 

Biophysical theory of olfactory sensing of complex odorant mixtures
------
In another line of research, we worked on the question of how olfactory receptor neurons in the nose deconstruct complex odors. Based on past experiments and theoretical arguments, we proposed a novel biophysical mechanism based on ligand-receptor antagonism which solves the olfactory cocktail-party problem, i.e., the computational task of identifying a specific scent against a complex background. The theory recently received striking validation in a series of experiments conducted in collaboration with the Murthy lab at Harvard and the fragrance company Firmenich, in addition to other groups. 

Statistical physics of phenotypic evolution
------
Recently, I have worked on the mechanisms behind predictable phenotypic evolution, specifically to explain patterns of diminishing-returns and increasing-costs epistasis observed in microbial genetics experiments. I developed a new Fourier analysis-based framework to analyze the role of epistasis on historical contingency and showed that diminishing-returns and increasing-costs are generic consequences of widespread epistatic interactions. I proposed a fitness landscape model to show that phenotypic evolution can be simple and predictable even if the underlying trait is complex.
